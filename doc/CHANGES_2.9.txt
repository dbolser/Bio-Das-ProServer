Changes:

Migrated to Module::Build for more informative build process.
Added XSL stylesheet for sequence command.
Fixed versioning for SVN-style revisions.
Now sends "type" parameters to build_features
Standardised setting of source configuration parameters - now all are retrieved from:
  method
  stack
  ini
Features command now has consistent way of getting segment version (first from the feature, then the method)

Added SourceAdaptor::hydra method
Added SourceAdaptor::server_url method
Added SourceAdaptor::source_url method
Added SourceAdaptor::strict_boundaries method

Default SourceAdaptor::dsncreated method now gets last modified time from hydra (if available) before the transport

Swapped the default priorities for source_uri and version_uri (i.e. version_uri defaults to dsn, and source_uri defaults to version_uri).

The dsn command now makes use of the title attribute.
